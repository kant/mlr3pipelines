#'
#' @description
#' Feature filtering using a [`mlr3filters::Filter`] object, see the
#' \CRANpkg{mlr3filters} package.
#'
#' If a `Filter` can only operate on a subset of columns based on column type, then only these features are considered and filtered.
#' `nfeat` and `frac` will count for the features of the type that the `Filter` can operate on;
#' this means e.g. that setting `nfeat` to 0 will only remove features of the type that the `Filter` can work with.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpFilter$new(filter, id = filter$id, param_vals = list())
#' ```
#' * `filter` :: [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter]\cr
#'   [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] used for feature filtering.
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`
#'   Identifier of the resulting  object, defaulting to the `id` of the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] being used.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with features removed that were filtered out.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as:
#' * `scores` :: named `numeric`\cr
#'   Scores calculated for all features of the training [`Task`][mlr3::Task] which are being used
#'   as cutoff for feature filtering. If `frac` or `nfeat` is given, the underlying [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] may choose to not calculate scores for
#'   all features that are given. This only includes features on which the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] can operate; e.g.
#'   if the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] can only operate on numeric features, then scores for factorial features will not be given.
#' * `features` :: `character`\cr
#'   Names of features that are being kept. Features of types that the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] can not operate on are always being kept.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from the [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as the parameters of the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter]
#' used by this object. Besides, parameters introduced are:
#' * `filter.nfeat` :: `numeric(1)` \cr
#'   Number of features to select.
#'   Mutually exclusive with `frac` and `cutoff`.
#' * `filter.frac` :: `numeric(1)` \cr
#'   Fraction of features to keep.
#'   Mutually exclusive with `nfeat` and `cutoff`.
#' * `filter.cutoff` :: `numeric(1)` \cr
#'   Minimum value of filter heuristic for which to keep features.
#'   Mutually exclusive with `nfeat` and `frac`.
#'
#' Note that at least one of `filter.nfeat`, `filter.frac`, or `filter.cutoff` must be given.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' This does *not* use the `$select_cols` feature of [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`] to select only features compatible with the [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter];
#' instead the whole [`Task`][mlr3::Task] is used by `$get_state()` and subset internally.
#'
#' @section Fields:
#' Fields inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as:
#' * `filter` :: [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter]\cr
#'   [`Filter`][mlr3filters::Filter] that is being used for feature filtering. Do *not* use this slot to get to the feature filtering scores
#'   after training; instead, use `$state$scores`. Read-only.
#'
#' @section Methods:
#' Methods inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreprocSimple`]/[`PipeOpTaskPreproc`]/[`PipeOp`].
